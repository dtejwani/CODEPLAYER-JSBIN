# CODEPLAYER-JSBIN
 It is a clone of a webapp specifically designed to help JavaScript and CSS folk test snippets of code, within some context, and debug the code collaboratively. 
 JS Bin allows you to edit and test JavaScript and HTML (reloading the URL also maintains the state of your code - new tabs doesn't).
